# Foundry Stream Overlay 4.0

Create stunning, dynamic greenâ€‘screen overlays from your FoundryÂ VTT game and drop them straight into OBS (or any broadcast software). Show live stats, dice rolls, animations and moreâ€”no browser-source fiddling each session.

## Main New Features inÂ 4.0

- **Modular codebase**: Massive refactor into `js/core`, `js/ui`, and `js/overlay`, delivering faster load and reaction times.  
- **Redesigned UI**: Modernised look and improved functionality for all configuration and overlay windows.  
- **Dice roll display**: Live roll results on overlay with multiple styling/display options. Two premium extras:  
  - **Simple roll animation**: brief animation before the final number appears.  
  - **BG3 style**: incremental bonus values crash into and build up the displayed result.  
- **Fully customisable HP bars**: Tailor size, colour, segmentsâ€”and soon extend with image overlays and rich graphics.  
- **Standalone companion app (coming soon)**: local server enabling true transparent overlays (no green screen). Development ongoing for a 4.x patch.

## Installation

1. In FoundryÂ VTT, go to **Addâ€‘on Modules â†’ Install Module**.  
2. Paste the manifest URL:  
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darkjenso/FoundryStreamOverlay/refs/heads/main/module.json`  
3. Click **Install**, then enable the module in your World.

> **Updating from â‰¤3.5.1?** Export your overlay data first (Module Settings â†’ Data Management). Some CSS selectors and template paths have changedâ€”doubleâ€‘check any custom overlays/macros.  
> ðŸš¨ **Warning:** Upgrading to 4.0 may **delete or reset** layouts created in 3.x. Back up all your layouts/settings before updating!

## Quick Start

1. **Open the Overlay Window** via module settings or macro. Point OBS to that URL (Browser Source + chroma key if needed).  
2. **Create/Load a Layout**: add HP bars, portraits, status effects, dice results, etc. Duplicate items with the new button to speed builds.  
3. **Add Animations (Premium)**: use the Animation Manager to define entrance/loop animations.  
4. **Save/Export** your setup to a JSON file for backup.

## Standalone Companion App (Coming Soon)

A separate app will spin up a local server and render true transparent overlays (alpha channel), removing the need for chroma key or window capture. First release will require an **active monthly Patreon subscription**.

## Premium vs Free

The core overlay is free. Premium unlocks advanced tools:

- **How to get Premium**: support on Patreon to receive a oneâ€‘time activation key.  
- **Activation**: oneâ€‘time for 4.xâ€”no recurring online check.  
- **Future model may change**: subscription or perâ€‘version keys may be introduced.

If opened without a licence, premiumâ€‘only UI shows a friendly purchase prompt.

## Configuration & Customisation

- **Settings**: *Configuration â†’ Module Settings â†’ Foundry Stream Overlay*  
- **CSS**: drop overrides into your theme or `styles/*.css`.  
- **Macros**: example pack in the compendium. Hooks are in `js/core/hooks.js`.

## Known Limitations

- Some systems need custom field mappings.  
- Many simultaneous animations may impact lowâ€‘end hardware.

## Known Issues

- Triggered/entrance animations are temporarily disabled due to integration issues with the companion app. A fix is in progress.
