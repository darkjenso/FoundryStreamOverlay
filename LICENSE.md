**Foundry Stream Overlay – Proprietary, Source‑Available Licence v1.1**  
Copyright © 2025 Jennifer Murray (“Licensor”)

> *Plain English summary*: Use it in your own games/streams (commercial use of the output is fine) and read the code, but you cannot redistribute the code or bypass premium checks/keys. Premium for the Foundry module is unlocked with a **one‑time activation key via Patreon** (Section 5). The standalone companion app will require an **active monthly Patreon subscription** to run. The Licensor may change how premium is sold/activated for future versions.
