```
// Replace "MyLayoutName" with the layout you wish to activate.
let newLayout = "MyLayoutName";
game.settings.set("foundrystreamoverlay", "activeLayout", newLayout)
  .then(() => {
    ui.notifications.info(`Active layout set to ${newLayout}`);
    if (window.foundryStreamOverlayApp) {
      window.foundryStreamOverlayApp.render();
    }
  })
  .catch(err => console.error("Failed to set active layout:", err));
